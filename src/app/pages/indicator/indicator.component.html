        Welcome to Logframe Lab
      </h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Logframe Lab is an open source web application created to help NGOs and community-based organisations match
        their project ideas with the most relevant metrics for tracking their success. This tool leads you step-by-step
        through a simple process that results in a formatted, logical framework (logframe) that you can download and use
        for reporting your progress to your funders.

<div id="step1" class="stepInfo" *ngIf="current ===  0">
  <p class="stepPara"> First, either upload a single Word document here (.doc or .docx) or start from scratch,
    adding the relevant text. You can use your grant or project funding application file for this purpose. When you have
    selected the document you wish to upload, or finished typing your text, click Next.
  </p>
</div>

  <div id="step2" class="stepInfo" *ngIf="current ===  1">
    <p>Now select the theme(s) that best apply to the subject of your project. You may select as many themes as you
      want.
      Then click Next.
    </p>
    <div>
      <p class="stepPara">Note: If you are unsure which themes are relevant, don’t worry – you’ll be able to add more filters in Step 4.

    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="step3" class="stepInfo" *ngIf="current ===  2">
    <p class="stepPara">Your document is now being uploaded and scanned for appropriate keywords. The green check mark lets you know when
      your document is done. Then click Next.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="step4" class="stepInfo" *ngIf="current ===  3">
    <p >Here are the suggested indicators for you, based on the keywords in your document and the themes selected.
      Indicators are categorised as Impacts, Outcomes, or Outputs. Select the indicators you want to use to track the
      success of your project, then click Next.</p>
    <div>
      <p class="stepPara" >  Note: In this step, you can select additional themes or indicators that you wish to include in your logframe.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="step5" class="stepInfo" *ngIf="current ===  4">
    <p class="stepPara">Now you can arrange your indicators to note which Outputs belong with which Outcomes, and which Outcomes are
      assigned to which Impacts. Once you have finished grouping these indicators, click Next.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="step6" class="stepInfo" *ngIf="current ===  5">
    <p class="stepPara">Here the indicators have been put into a logframe that you can now download and use for tracking progress on your
      project – and for reporting to funders.
